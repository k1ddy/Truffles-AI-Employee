## Why This Survey

We're building an AI assistant that will chat with customers via WhatsApp instead of a human manager. For the bot to sound natural (not robotic), we need **real examples** of how customers actually write and what they ask.

**Without this data = dumb bot. With data = smart bot.**

Takes **15-20 minutes**. Answer honestly — we need reality, not polished answers.
